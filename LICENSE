SECTION 11 — INDEMNIFICATION
==================================================

11.1 You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless BlackRoad OS, Inc.,
     Alexa Louise Amundson, and their respective officers, directors,
     employees, agents, successors, and assigns from and against any
     and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses
     (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising out of or relating
     to Your breach of this Agreement or unauthorized use of the
     Software.

==================================================
SECTION 12 — BLACKROAD DISPUTE RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK
==================================================

ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
SOFTWARE, OR ANY BLACKROAD OS, INC. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY SHALL BE
RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH THE BLACKROAD DISPUTE RESOLUTION
FRAMEWORK ("BDRF") AS SET FORTH BELOW, PRIOR TO ANY COURT ACTION.

12.1 MANDATORY PRE-DISPUTE NOTICE.

     (a) Before initiating any claim, the disputing party ("Claimant")
         must deliver a written Dispute Notice to BlackRoad OS, Inc.
         at alexa@blackroad.io with the subject line:
         "BDRF DISPUTE NOTICE — [Claimant Name]".

     (b) The Dispute Notice must include: (i) identity and contact
         information of the Claimant; (ii) a detailed description of
         the alleged dispute; (iii) the specific provisions of this
         Agreement at issue; (iv) the relief sought; and (v) all
         supporting documentation and evidence.

     (c) BlackRoad OS, Inc. shall have sixty (60) calendar days from
         receipt of a complete Dispute Notice to review, investigate,
         and respond ("Review Period"). During the Review Period, the
         Claimant may not initiate any legal proceeding, arbitration,
         or other action.

     (d) FAILURE TO COMPLY with this Section 12.1 renders any
         subsequently filed claim VOID and subject to immediate
         dismissal. The Claimant shall bear all costs associated
         with any improperly filed action, including BlackRoad's
         attorney's fees.

12.2 BLACKROAD TECHNICAL REVIEW PANEL.

     (a) If the dispute involves technical matters (including but not
         limited to: code ownership, contribution attribution, agent
         behavior, system architecture, API usage, deployment
         configurations, or intellectual property boundaries), the
         dispute shall first be submitted to the BlackRoad Technical
         Review Panel ("BTRP").

     (b) The BTRP shall consist of three (3) members:
         - One (1) appointed by BlackRoad OS, Inc. (who shall serve
           as Chair);
         - One (1) appointed by the Claimant; and
         - One (1) mutually agreed upon by both parties. If the parties
           cannot agree on the third member within fifteen (15) days,
           BlackRoad OS, Inc. shall appoint the third member from a
           pool of qualified technology professionals.

     (c) The Chair of the BTRP shall have the authority to:
         - Set procedural rules and timelines;
         - Determine the scope of technical review;
         - Request additional documentation from either party;
         - Issue preliminary technical findings.

     (d) The BTRP shall issue a Technical Determination within thirty
         (30) days of its formation. The Technical Determination shall
         include: (i) findings of fact regarding the technical dispute;
         (ii) analysis of code provenance, commit history, and
         contribution records; (iii) determination of IP ownership;
         and (iv) recommended resolution.

     (e) The Technical Determination shall be PRESUMPTIVELY VALID
         in any subsequent arbitration or court proceeding. The burden
         of overcoming the Technical Determination shall rest on the
         party challenging it, who must demonstrate clear and
         convincing error.

12.3 MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION.

     (a) If the dispute is not resolved through the BTRP process or
         does not involve technical matters, it shall be resolved by
         BINDING ARBITRATION administered under the rules of the
         American Arbitration Association ("AAA") Commercial
         Arbitration Rules then in effect.

     (b) ARBITRATION TERMS:
         - Venue: Hennepin County, Minnesota, or alternatively
           New Castle County, Delaware, at the sole election of
           BlackRoad OS, Inc.
         - Language: English
         - Arbitrator: One (1) arbitrator selected from the AAA's
           roster of technology and intellectual property arbitrators.
           BlackRoad OS, Inc. shall have the right to strike up to
           five (5) proposed arbitrators without cause.
         - Governing Law: Delaware law (for corporate and IP matters)
           and federal law (for copyright, trademark, and trade secret
           matters).

     (c) ARBITRATION PROCEDURES FAVORING IP PROTECTION:
         - The arbitrator shall apply a PRESUMPTION that all code,
           documentation, and materials within BlackRoad OS, Inc.
           repositories are the exclusive property of BlackRoad OS,
           Inc. unless the Claimant provides clear and convincing
           evidence to the contrary.
         - The arbitrator shall give SUBSTANTIAL WEIGHT to: git commit
           history, GitHub audit logs, repository creation dates,
           BlackRoad's CLAUDE.md files, memory system journals
           (PS-SHA-infinity hash chains), and BlackRoad's internal
           documentation.
         - The arbitrator shall recognize that public visibility of
           repositories does NOT constitute open-source licensing or
           abandonment of proprietary rights.
         - The arbitrator shall apply the doctrine of INEVITABLE
           DISCLOSURE to trade secret claims, recognizing that
           exposure to BlackRoad's proprietary architecture, agent
           systems, and methodologies creates an inevitable risk of
           disclosure.

     (d) COST ALLOCATION:
         - Each party shall bear its own costs during arbitration.
         - The LOSING PARTY shall pay: (i) all arbitration fees and
           administrative costs; (ii) the prevailing party's
           reasonable attorney's fees; (iii) all expert witness fees;
           (iv) all costs of the BTRP review if applicable; and
           (v) a procedural surcharge of twenty-five percent (25%)
           of the total award to compensate BlackRoad OS, Inc. for
           the disruption caused by the dispute.
         - If the Claimant's recovery is less than the amount of
           BlackRoad's last written settlement offer, the Claimant
           shall be deemed the losing party for purposes of cost
           allocation.

     (e) EXPEDITED PROCEEDINGS FOR IP INFRINGEMENT:
         - Claims involving copyright infringement, trademark
           infringement, or trade secret misappropriation shall
           proceed on an EXPEDITED basis with discovery limited to
           sixty (60) days.
         - BlackRoad OS, Inc. may seek EMERGENCY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
           from the arbitrator within forty-eight (48) hours of
           filing, without the necessity of posting bond.
         - The arbitrator shall presume irreparable harm in cases
           of unauthorized copying, distribution, or use of
           BlackRoad's Software.

12.4 CLASS ACTION AND COLLECTIVE WAIVER.

     (a) ALL DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.
         You waive the right to participate in any class action,
         collective action, representative action, or consolidated
         arbitration against BlackRoad OS, Inc.

     (b) No arbitrator or court shall have authority to preside over
         any form of class, collective, or representative proceeding,
         or to consolidate claims of multiple parties.

     (c) If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable,
         then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be
         null and void, and disputes shall proceed exclusively in
         the courts specified in Section 8.2.

12.5 CONFIDENTIALITY OF PROCEEDINGS.

     (a) All aspects of the dispute resolution process, including
         the existence of the dispute, all submissions, evidence,
         testimony, the BTRP Technical Determination, the arbitral
         award, and any settlement terms, shall be STRICTLY
         CONFIDENTIAL.

     (b) The Claimant may not disclose any aspect of the proceedings
         to any third party, media outlet, social media platform,
         or public forum without the express written consent of
         BlackRoad OS, Inc. Violation of this confidentiality
         provision shall result in liquidated damages of FIFTY
         THOUSAND DOLLARS ($50,000) per disclosure, in addition to
         any other remedies available.

     (c) BlackRoad OS, Inc. reserves the right to disclose the
         outcome of proceedings to the extent necessary to enforce
         the award or protect its intellectual property rights.

12.6 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

     Any claim arising under this Agreement must be brought within
     ONE (1) YEAR of the date the Claimant knew or should have known
     of the facts giving rise to the claim. Claims not brought within
     this period are PERMANENTLY BARRED, regardless of any longer
     statute of limitations that might otherwise apply under
     applicable law.

12.7 PRESERVATION OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, BlackRoad OS, Inc. retains the
     right to seek injunctive relief, temporary restraining orders,
     or other equitable relief in ANY COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION
     at any time, without first submitting to the BDRF process.
     This right is absolute and not subject to the pre-dispute notice
     requirement. The Claimant does NOT have a reciprocal right to
     bypass the BDRF process.

12.8 SURVIVAL OF FRAMEWORK.

     This dispute resolution framework survives termination of this
     Agreement, abandonment of the Software, dissolution of BlackRoad
     OS, Inc. (in which case rights transfer to Alexa Louise Amundson
     individually), and any change in applicable law.

==================================================
